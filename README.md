  I have created a website which contains two sides , user and admin.It can show information about work done by various politicians in various region. A user can view the work done in their region , by which politician it is done. Also user can search by post or region or both in search bar to view work done in other regions also.Along with it a user has feature to login,signin,update profile and logout as well.
  Now let's come to admin side.An adin has login facility , whose credentials can directly be stored in database.Admin also has logout feature.An admin can add record of work done by politician , delete any record of politician work , an admin can also delete any user.There is also search bar provided to admin section similar to that of user ; by searching there,record of politician work can be deleted or another politician can be added.
  At backend , I have used node.js and express.js along with mongodb. Frontend is created usng bootstrap and react.js.
